# CS225 Final Project for sknight5-ryderch2-lukep2-jcharl4

## Team Contract

### Communication:

1. **Meetings** We will meet at least once a week for the first few weeks of the project on Wednesdays using discord. 
We will meet for at least an hour, with one of us taking notes to describe the work that has been done for the week. 
We will keep the notes on a shared google drive folder.

2. **Assistance** We will all have each other as friends on discord and we have each other's emails if we need to contact each other. 

3. **Respect** We will make sure that we hold each other accountable in both sharing and valuing each other's ideas. If one of us is not contributing
enough or if one of us is contributing too much, we will all make sure to call them out without fear. With our signatures at the bottom of
this document, we will declare that we will all work to have a positive group environment.

### Collaboration:

1. **Distribution** At the start of each meeting, we as a team will decide how the work should be distributed and what each group memeber is 
responsible for the week. We will start by laying out all that needs to be done for the week, and then we will all volunteer for 
the work that we will do that week. If no one volunteers, we will assign the work based on the relative workload of all members.

2. **Commitment** We all are expected to put in from 2 to 5 hours of work per week individually. If a member feels like they have not worked 
enough, they are responsible to ask other members how they can help, and if a member feels they have too much on their docket, they are to
ask the rest of the group to help finish it on time. Sometimes, life happens, so if one week someone is very busy with life outside of the project,
the rest of the group will help pick up the slack and help them out. However, if this becomes a habit of blaming a busy life, we will discuss other options.

3. **Conflict Resolution** Whenever there is a conflict between two members, we will talk about it in the next meeting as a group and we will try and
resiolve the conflict in a mature manner. If there is a mass conflict between all 4 of us, we will email our group mentor or ask an outside friend for council.
